# FINDINGS.md -- current evidence ledger

Updated 2026-09-02. This file keeps only findings that should survive the
next kernel, driver, or backend refresh. Commands and raw evidence live
in JOURNAL.md and docs/.

## Host and topology

CONFIG -> Linux 7.1.0-070100, two Intel Arc Pro B70 cards, KMD xe,
  Compute Runtime / NEO 26.22.38646.4.

RESULT -> Kernel 7.1 aligned the GuC firmware requirement and cured the
  former BCS copy-engine / device-lost hardware wedge. The host is
  headless. Neither card is display-held. The two B70s sit on separate
  Intel PCI bridges (09:00.0 and 42:00.0), not as siblings on one
  switch.

VERDICT -> Keep kernel 7.1 as the host baseline. Treat cross-card P2P
  as a measured property of this PCI tree, not a given.

Evidence: docs/HOST.md and b70_ai_things docs/P2P_GPU.md.

## TP=2 software boundary

CONFIG -> Historical vLLM multiprocess TP=2, oneCCL, graph capture,
  and direct P2P experiments on this host (recorded in b70_ai_things).

RESULT -> Raw peer DMA and standalone oneCCL P2P can work. The dangerous
  failure is process / queue handoff: repeated worker-init or graph-capture
  failures can poison later collectives and sometimes both cards.

VERDICT -> Do not enable arbitrary P2P for TP=2. Require per-card health,
  two-rank collective health, matched rank evidence, and teardown
  re-health around every risky TP=2 or PP=2 attempt.

## Kernels

No xe2x2-owned kernel finding yet. Do not import a serving-tree number
as a kernel result.

## PP=2

No xe2x2-owned pipeline-parallel finding yet.

## Mixed 2x2

Blocked until TP=2 and PP=2 each have a passing correctness + health
run in this repo.
